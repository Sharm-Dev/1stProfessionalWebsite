                    <h1>Hi all and welcome,</h1>
                    <p>This is my first time I have made a site using HTML, CSS, Flexbox and Javascript. I have really enjoyed making this and learning more knowledge to improve my skills.</p> 
                    <p>I am looking forward to being able to create more sites to keep on showcasing my achievements. I am open to any tips and knowledge that anyone can share with me, and I do hope you have enjoyed looking at the site as much as I did creating it. 
                        I thought this little bit of text would be more interesting to read then Lorem Ipsum :-).</p> 
                    <p>Have a great day and hope to speak to you more soon.</p>
